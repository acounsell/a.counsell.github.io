# About

I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.torontomu.ca/psychology/) at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).

I lead the Psychology and Statistics Education Research [(PASER) Lab](psystat.org).

My lab examines research topics related to statistics education, statistics anxiety, statistics attitudes, and statistical software.
